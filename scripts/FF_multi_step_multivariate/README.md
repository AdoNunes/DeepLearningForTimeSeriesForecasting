# Multi-step forecasting with multivariate input using feed-forward neural network

The hyperparameters of feed-forward neural network are tuned using Hyperdrive, a feature of Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) service. To run this code, open the [FF_multistep_multivariate_hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb](./FF_multistep_multivariate_hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb) notebook, and read the instructions.
