# Multi-step forecasting with encoder-decoder network and teacher forcing

The hyperparameters of teacher forcing recurrent neural network are tuned using Hyperdrive, a feature of Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) service. To run this code, open the [RNN_teacher_forcing_hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb](./RNN_teacher_forcing_hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb) notebook, and read the instructions.
