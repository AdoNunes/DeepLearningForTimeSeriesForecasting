# Multi-step forecasting with recurrent neural network that generates vector output

The hyperparameters of recurrent neural network are tuned using Hyperdrive, a feature of Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) service. To run this code, open the [RNN_multistep_hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb](./RNN_multistep_hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb) notebook, and read the instructions.
