# Multi-step forecasting using a simple encoder-decoder

The hyperparameters of encoder-decoder network are tuned using Hyperdrive, a feature of Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) service. To run this code, open the [RNN_encoder_decoder_hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb](./RNN_encoder_decoder_hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb) notebook, and read the instructions.
